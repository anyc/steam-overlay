	  Unlike Gentoo, Debian allows multiple copies of libcurl built
	  against different backends to be installed simultaneously. For
	  reasons best known to themselves, some developers release
	  binaries linked against libcurl-gnutls.so instead of libcurl.so,
	  the latter being the OpenSSL variant. Although it is less than
	  ideal, real world usage has shown that symlinking from one to
	  the other doesn't cause any issues so this package provides such
	  a symlink to satisfy prebuilt binaries. Usage of libcurl-nss.so
	  seems less common but a symlink for that has also been included
	  for completeness.
